# COMP 163 - Project 1: Character Creator & Chronicles
# 🎯 Project Overview

Build a text-based RPG character creation and story progression system that demonstrates mastery of functions and file I/O operations.

# Required Functions 
Complete these functions in project1_starter.py:

create_character(name, character_class) - Create new character

calculate_stats(character_class, level) - Calculate character stats

save_character(character, filename) - Save character to file

load_character(filename) - Load character from file

display_character(character) - Display character info

level_up(character) - Increase character level

# 🎭 Character Classes
Implement these character classes with unique stat distributions:


Warrior: High strength, low magic, high health

Mage: Low strength, high magic, medium health

Rogue: Medium strength, medium magic, low health

Cleric: Medium strength, high magic, high health

# 📁 Required File Format
Your save_character() function must create files in this exact format:

Character Name: [name]

Class: [class]

Level: [level]

Strength: [strength]

Magic: [magic]

Health: [health]

Gold: [gold]


# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_character_creation.py -v

DOCUMENTATION
From this coding project, I learned how to create and manage data using functions, dictionaries, and files in Python. Writing functions like calculate_stats() and create_character() helped me understand how to organize code and reuse logic instead of repeating it. I also learned how to save and load data from text files, which made me realize how file I/O works behind the scenes — opening, writing, reading, and closing files properly. Converting between strings and integers when loading data was a useful lesson in data types and error checking.

The most challenging part was debugging the file handling and data conversion in the load_character() function. It took time to figure out how to split each line correctly and handle missing or incorrect formatting. Overall, this project improved my ability to structure programs, handle data safely, and think through how each part connects to the rest.

A.I USAGE
Mostly used a.i for formatting code and help with debugging. Majorly helped with the load function. Helped with understand files and what to use in said files.
